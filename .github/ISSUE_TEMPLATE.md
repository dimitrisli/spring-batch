Thank you for taking time to open this issue!
You might have already read the [README file][1] and the [Contributor Guide][2], but as a reminder, please check the following:

### Asking questions

If you have a question, please use [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-batch) and tag your question
with `spring-batch`. We would like to keep the issue tracker exclusively for bug reports and feature requests.

### Reporting bugs

* Search Github issues first, and create an issue only if necessary (there might be already a duplicate issue)
* Provide as much details as possible: Spring Batch version, Java version, which database you use if any, etc
* If the bug is trivial, just go ahead and create the issue. Otherwise, please provide a failing unit test or a [minimal complete example][3] that reproduces the issue.

### Requesting features

* Search Github issues first, and create an issue only if necessary (the feature might have already been requested, but rejected)
* Explain the reason why you need this feature (aka why it is not possible to implement the desired functionality with the current version)
* Add a code example to explain what you think the feature should look like. This is optional, but it would help up understand your expectations.

Thank you upfront!
