[[whatsNewMetrics]]
=== Batch metrics with Micrometer

This release introduces a new feature that lets you monitor your batch jobs
by using Micrometer. By default, Spring Batch collects metrics (such as job duration,
step duration, item read and write throughput, and others) and registers them in Micrometer's
global metrics registry under the `spring.batch` prefix.
These metrics can be sent to any https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_supported_monitoring_systems[monitoring system]
supported by Micrometer.

For more details about this feature, please refer to the
<<monitoring-and-metrics.adoc#monitoring-and-metrics,Monitoring and metrics>> chapter.

=== Documentation updates

The reference documentation has been updated to match the same style as other
Spring projects.
